Perfect üëç thanks for sharing your **House Price Predictor README**.
It‚Äôs clean, step-by-step, and covers everything ‚Äî problem, objectives, dataset, methodology, evaluation, example, and how to run.

For your **Bank Transaction Fraud Detector (Project 20)** repo, you can follow **exactly the same style** so both projects look consistent on GitHub.

Here‚Äôs how your new README can look (parallel structure to your house price project):

# üè¶ Bank Transaction Fraud Detector

A Data Science & Machine Learning project to detect fraudulent banking transactions automatically. This project uses **Logistic Regression** (classification) from Scikit-Learn and provides **real-time fraud prediction** through a Streamlit web app.

---

## Problem Statement

Banks handle millions of transactions daily. Manual detection of fraud is slow, inconsistent, and leads to heavy financial losses.
This project builds a predictive machine learning model to classify whether a transaction is **Fraudulent** or **Legitimate**.

---

## Objectives

* Build a fraud classification model using Scikit-Learn.
* Predict fraud based on:

  * **Amount** (‚Çπ)
  * **Type** (ATM, Card, Online, BankTransfer)
  * **Location** (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Unknown)
* Evaluate model performance with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
* Provide **real-time fraud detection** through a Streamlit interface.

---

## Dataset

Custom synthetic dataset created with 500 rows:

* **TransactionID** (unique ID)
* **Amount** (numeric, ‚Çπ)
* **Type** (ATM, Card, Online, BankTransfer)
* **Location** (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Unknown)
* **IsFraud** (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent)

Distribution: \~27% Fraud, \~73% Legitimate

---

## Methodology (Workflow)

1. Load dataset using Pandas
2. Encode categorical features (LabelEncoder for `Type` and `Location`)
3. Scale numeric feature (`Amount`) with StandardScaler
4. Train-test split (70-30)
5. Train a **Logistic Regression model**
6. Evaluate model with Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
7. Take user input and predict transaction status (Fraud/Legit)
8. Build an interactive **Streamlit app** for real-time detection

---

## Model Evaluation

* **Accuracy:** \~90%
* **Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-score
* **Confusion Matrix:** Visualized for Fraud vs Legit predictions

üëâ Higher Accuracy = better fraud detection capability

---

## Example Prediction

**Input:**

* Amount: ‚Çπ 24,000
* Type: ATM
* Location: Unknown

**Output:**
üö® Fraudulent Transaction Detected!

## How to Run the Project

### Option 1 ‚Äì Run as Python Script

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bank-Fraud-Detector.git
cd Bank-Fraud-Detector
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

Run the project:

```bash
python fraud_detector.py
```

You will be asked to enter: Amount, Type, Location. The model will predict Fraudulent / Legitimate.

---

### Option 2 ‚Äì Run with Streamlit (Interactive Web App)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open a browser window with an interactive interface to test fraud predictions.

---

### Option 3 ‚Äì Running in VS Code

* Open VS Code ‚Üí File ‚Üí Open Folder ‚Üí select the project folder (`Bank-Fraud-Detector`).
* Make sure Python is installed & selected in VS Code.
* Open terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + backtick`).

Run Python script:

```bash
python fraud_detector.py
```

Run Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

‚úÖ This structure is **parallel to your House Price Predictor README**, so both projects will look professional and consistent on GitHub.

üëâ Do you want me to also write a **short ‚ÄúFeatures of the App‚Äù section** (like ‚ÄúReal-time detection, Graphical insights, Handles unseen categories‚Äù) so your repo stands out more?
